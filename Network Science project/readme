This is the final project for the Network Science course I followed.
The focus here is on analyzing the network structure of Reddit and the interactions among subreddits during the 2016-2017 period, which was significant due to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
The goal was to uncover changes in subreddit interactions, particularly those related to Trump, and understand the dynamics surrounding the election.
We start by studying the degree distribution of the graph, which turns out to be a power-law distribution.
This lead us to compute several network statistics, both theoreticaly and empirically, which helped us understand the network structure.
The network displayed characteristics of sparsity and randomness, as indicated by low clustering and assortativity coefficients.
Measures of centrality, such as degree centrality, Pagerank and HITS, were deployed to provide insights into the importance of the different nodes.
Further, community detection algorithms, such as Spectral Clustering, Louvain and Authority Shifting, were used to identify communities within the network.
We also study the network robusteness via the Molloy-Reed criterion, and explore several network-based link prediction techniques: Resource Allocation, 
Overall, the analysis highlighted the impact of the 2016 U.S. presidential election on subreddit interactions, as we expected.
Interestingly, we find a very strong correlation between the two major subreddits: 'the_donald' and 'conspiracy', the former revolving around ex POTUS Donald Trump, while the latter revolving around conspiracy theories.
This was definitely one of the most interesting project I have worked on and maybe also the one I'm most proud of.
I hope this study could serve as a starting point for future developments, including the exploration of overlapping community detection
algorithms and statistical methods of link prediction.
