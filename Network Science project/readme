This project, undertaken as the final assignment for my Network Science course, focuses on the analysis of Reddit's network structure and the interactions among subreddits during the crucial 2016-2017 period, marked by Donald Trump's election as President of the United States.
The primary objective was to uncover changes in subreddit interactions, particularly those related to Trump, and gain insights into the dynamics surrounding the election.
The investigation began by examining the degree distribution of the graph, revealing a power-law distribution. Subsequently, a range of network statistics were computed, both theoretically and empirically, to deepen our understanding of the network structure.
The analysis revealed features of sparsity and randomness, as evidenced by low clustering and assortativity coefficients.
Centrality measures, including degree centrality, Pagerank, and HITS, were employed to evaluate the importance of different nodes within the network. 
Additionally, community detection algorithms such as Spectral Clustering, Louvain, and Authority Shifting were utilized to identify distinct communities within the network.
To assess the network's robustness, we applied the Molloy-Reed criterion, finding strong vulnerability to targeted node removal, consistent with the underlying power-law distribution
Moreover, several network-based link prediction techniques were explored.
The findings shed light on the impact of the 2016 U.S. presidential election on subreddit interactions, aligning with our initial expectations.
Of particular interest is the strong correlation observed between two major subreddits: 'the_donald' and 'conspiracy.' The former centered around former President Donald Trump, while the latter revolved around conspiracy theories. 
This project was definitely one of the most interesting I have worked on, and perhaps the one I am most proud of.
I hope this study can serve as a starting point for future developments, including the exploration of overlapping community detection algorithms and statistical methods for link prediction.
