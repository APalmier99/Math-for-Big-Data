This project focused on analyzing the network structure of Reddit and the interactions among subreddits during the 2016-2017 period,
which was significant due to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
The goal was to uncover changes in subreddit interactions, particularly those related to Trump,
and understand the dynamics surrounding the election.
The analysis revealed that the network's degree distribution followed a power law,
with the subreddit "the_donald" playing a central role in connecting various subreddits.
The network displayed characteristics of sparsity and randomness, as indicated by low clustering and assortativity coefficients.
Measures of centrality, such as degree centrality, Pagerank and HITS, provided insights into the importance of different nodes.
Community detection algorithms, such as Louvain and Authority Shifting, identified consistent and coherent communities within the network, allowing for observations at different levels of granularity.
The network also showed vulnerability to node-targeted attacks, consistent with its underlying power-law distribution.
Additionally, we explored network-based link prediction techniques, with the Resource Allocation method performing the best.
However, the precision of all link prediction methods was low, likely due to the sparsity of the graph and the presence of nodes with only one link.
Overall, the analysis highlighted the impact of the 2016 U.S. presidential election on subreddit interactions,
particularly in relation to conspiracy theories.
I hope this study could serve as a starting point for future developments, including the exploration of overlapping community detection
algorithms and statistical methods of link prediction.
