This folder contains assignments from my course "Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods for Big Data", 
which delved into some powerful Numerical Linear Algebra techniques for handling Big Data.
The course was one of the best I have ever taken and I am sorry that these assignments do not fully reflect that.
They are rather haphazard, missing some of the details, and this honestly bothers me.
Time permitting, I will return to these files to add some detailed theoretical explanation and to experiment with some clustering algorithms.
For now, unfortunately, this is the current state of affairs.
